/* This file is now deprecated - backdrop-filter effects have been replaced */
/* 
  Previous backdrop-filter issues with transitions have been resolved by:
  
  1. Removing all backdrop-filter/backdrop-blur usage
  2. Implementing transition-friendly frosted glass effects using:
     - Layered box-shadows for depth
     - CSS gradients for glass-like appearance
     - Inset shadows for realistic lighting
     - Smooth hover animations with translateY
  
  These effects provide the same visual appeal as backdrop-filter
  but work seamlessly with CSS transitions and animations.
  
  See globals.css for the new .frosted-glass and .frosted-glass-hover classes.
